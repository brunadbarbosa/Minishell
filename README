1. On exit, before closing the program, the function must call ft_clean_shell. I did it, but do not
understand how it affects exit codes and exist statuses.

2. echo mut be able to be redirected. If the user puts "echo text > outfile" ou "echo text >> outfile",
there will be a cmd->redirs in that node, which will have the fd of the file, already opened with
the necessary permissions (truncate or append). Maybe if !cmd->redirs it prints to the STDOUT_FILENO,
and if cmd->redirs it prints to cmd->redirs->fd.

3. check if echo must print the prompt ("minishell> ") again before the message, if we are on STDOUT
